# My Recommender System Project

This is a placeholder article. It explains how I built a movie recommender system with collaborative filtering, federated learning, and large language models for personalized summaries.

Key points:
- Python + PyTorch + Flower (federated learning)
- Graph-based embeddings for POI recommendation
- Integration of LLMs for dynamic item description rewriting
